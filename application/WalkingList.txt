You have passed a skeleton.
Darkness...
It's cold in here.
What was that?
You are entering deeper in the dungeon!
A lot of scary things are in here...
Is it just me or you can feel someone else down here?
Why everything must be covered in mold?
Why did i get here ?!?!???
*whispers* help...
*dip* *dip* *dip*
There is water somewhere.
Who said that ??
I think im going crazy!
More skeletons...
Mold...mold...mold...It's all mold.
Ugh! Spiders.
I hate spiderweb in my hair.
... To dungeons deep, and caverns old.
Ohh.. Misty moutains cold.
It's so dark.
Aaghhh! My feet are freezing!
Am i alone here?
Did i took the right path?
There is no going back...
